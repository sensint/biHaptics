## About The Project

![Banner images][banner-image]

Perceiving material properties such as elasticity, flexibility, and torsion is inherently bimanual, as we rely on the relative motion of our hands to form a unified sense of materiality. Yet, most vibrotactile material rendering approaches are limited to a single hand or finger. While prior work has explored bimanual haptic interfaces, most depend on specialized hardware for specific interactions. In this paper, we demonstrate design strategies to support bimanual material exploration through motion-coupled vibrotactile feedback. Our technique introduces variable crosstalk between the controllers' vibration to evoke connectedness, making two unconnected devices feel as though they manipulate a single object. The technique generalizes motion-coupled feedback approaches beyond previous single-point explorations. Through two user studies, we show that this approach (1) significantly enhances perceived connectedness and (2) conveys distinct material qualities such as elasticity and torsion. Finally, we present Dvihastīya, an authoring tool for designing connected bimanual experiences in virtual reality.

### Built With

## Getting Started

Download the code from the GitHub website or clone repo using your favorite git-client software or with the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sensint/biHaptics.git
   ```
- To run the processing script (Targetting_Task.pde) as is, please add all the trajectories in the same folder as the processing file.
- Assign the right port for the serial communication.
- Run the script
